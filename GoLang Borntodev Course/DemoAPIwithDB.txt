This is a simple Go program that sets up a connection to a MySQL database, and defines functions for interacting with the database to retrieve, insert, and delete rows from a table. The database connection is made using the mysql driver from the database/sql package, and the database connection details are passed as a string in the format username:password@protocol(address)/dbname.

The Course type is defined as a struct with four fields, each with a corresponding JSON tag that specifies the names of the fields in the JSON representation of the type.

The SetupDB function is used to open a connection to the MySQL database and set the connection pool settings.

The getCourselist function is used to retrieve a list of courses from the database. It uses the QueryContext function on the database connection to execute a SELECT statement, and then scans the resulting rows into a slice of Course values.

The insertProduct function is used to insert a new course into the database. It uses the ExecContext function on the database connection to execute an INSERT statement, and returns the last inserted ID.

The getCourse function is used to retrieve a single course from the database based on its courseid. It uses the QueryRowContext function on the database connection to execute a SELECT statement and scan the resulting row into a Course value.

The RemoveCourse function is used to delete a course from the database based on its courseid. It uses the ExecContext function on the database connection to execute a DELETE statement.

The main function sets up a HTTP server and defines handler functions for handling HTTP requests at different routes. The /api/courses route is used to retrieve a list of courses from the database, and the /api/courses/{id} route is used to retrieve a single course by its id. The /api/courses route also accepts HTTP POST requests for inserting a new course into the database, and the /api/courses/{id} route accepts HTTP DELETE requests for deleting a course from the database.
